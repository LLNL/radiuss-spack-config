# RADIUSS Spack Testing

The RADIUSS project promotes and supports key High Performance Computing (HPC) open-source software developed at the LLNL. These tools and libraries cover a wide range of features a team would need to develop a modern simulation code targeting HPC plaftorms.

RADIUSS Spack Testing is a sub-project from the RADIUSS initiative providing a
testing infrastructure to test Spack Packages automatically in GitLab while
tracking changes in Spack.

Access the [documentation](https://radiuss-spack-testing.readthedocs.io/).

## Getting Started

The primary goal of this repo is to be used in Gitlab. The Gitlab CI configuration is such that it will use Spack pipeline feature to generate and run a pipeline that builds one of the environments in the `spack-environments` directory.

The specific environment to be built is controlled by the CI variable `ENV_NAME`.
